Energy Use Intensity (EUI): 
When you benchmark your building in Portfolio Manager, one of the key metrics you’ll see is energy use intensity, or EUI. Essentially, the EUI expresses a building’s energy use as a function of its size or other characteristics.

Thoughts:
1. Based on the sample (11,000 commercial buildings), get the training set of the commercial building energy performance of the whole State.
2. The trained data can be used in the energy benchmarking analysis for building owner
