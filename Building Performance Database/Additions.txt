Linear Regression
1) place Train & Test info on ONE row --> shifted over to the right a little
      Train 0.967       Test 0.352

2) fix the graph so it adjusts with the window size

Random Forest
1) use FR_withFloorPlan_weight to build a chart
    * same for FR_NoFloorPlan_weight

2) Create Train and Test objects as above with Linear Regression
   * When FLOOR AREA is selected:
        use FR_withFloorPlan_score

   * When FLOOR AREA is NOT selected:
	use FR_NoFloorPlan_score
