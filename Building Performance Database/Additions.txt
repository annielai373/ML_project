Linear Regression (Y= site EUI)
1) place Train & Test Score on ONE row --> shifted over to the right a little
      Train 0.967       Test 0.352

2) fix the graph so it adjusts with the window size

3) Occupency --> "Occupancy"

Random Forest
1) use FR_withFloorPlan_weight to build a table (2 decimals)
    * same for FR_NoFloorPlan_weight

2) Create Train and Test objects as above with Linear Regression
   * When FLOOR AREA is selected:
        use FR_withFloorPlan_score

   * When FLOOR AREA is NOT selected:
	use FR_NoFloorPlan_score

3) Keep colors the same for TEST & TRAIN #'s
