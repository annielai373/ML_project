Linear Regression (Y= site EUI)
1) place Train & Test Score on ONE row --> shifted over to the right a little
      Train 0.967       Test 0.352

2) fix the graph so it adjusts with the window size

3) Occupency --> "Occupancy"

Random Forest
1) use FR_withFloorPlan_weight to build a table (2 decimals)
    * same for FR_NoFloorPlan_weight

2) Create Train and Test objects as above with Linear Regression
   * When FLOOR AREA is selected:
        use FR_withFloorPlan_score

   * When FLOOR AREA is NOT selected:
	use FR_NoFloorPlan_score

3) Keep colors the same for TEST & TRAIN #'s

************************************** NEW ITEMS ****************************

1) CONTINENTAL tab
   * The graphs need to have the same LOWER bound of 0 for ALL the graphs

2) GREENHOUSE tab
   * Change color of line to GREEN - or emoothing smoothing line that was removed

3) CONTINENTAL, GREENHOUSE, & ECONOMIC SECTOR tabs
   * Reduce the bottom drop down so it takes up 1 column
   * Move the citations so they remain under graph- regradless of the screen size



4) NYC tab
   a) Move the citations so they remain under graph- regradless of the screen size

--- LINEAR REGRESSION
   b) Change the colors!! 

   c) Change "Samples" to "

   d) Add "LINEAR REGRESSION: " in front of  "Y= site EUI"

   e) Reduce the Train & Test score boxes & center

---- RANDOM FOREST
   f) Capitalize to "RANDOM FOREST"
      *Place on the same row as Train & Test score boxes

   g) Make the Random Forest Train & Test score boxes look the same as the LR ones
      *Yeah- we knew the scores did NOT channge!! 
      *We've spent a LOT of time with the data...unlike someone (code-lover)!!

   h) Under FEATURES of Random Forest, change the spelling to "Electricity"

----- BOTH
   i) Align the LR & Random Forest Train & Test score boxes so they can be easily seen together
