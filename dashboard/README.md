## Changes to Make

I'm okay with "Continental" as the label for the tab, as it expresses Continental Consumption and Continental Production rather than Continent Consumption and Continent Production.  "Continent" is already in the drop down menu; this reduces reduncancy.

Place the following reference at the bottom of the page for Continent[al], Economic Sector, and Gases tabs:
DATA SOURCE: EPA (https://www.epa.gov/)

For all graphs in the Continent[al], Economic Sector, and Gases tabs, update y-axis labels from "British Termal Unit(Btu)" to "British termal unit (Btu)".  The T and the U should be lower cased and there should be a space between "unit" and "(Btu)".

Update the name of "Gases" tab to "Greenhouse Gas".

In Sector dropdown menu, capitalize "S" in "Us Territories".

In Continents dropdown menu, add "&": from "Central South America" to "Central & South America".

For all legends in the Continent[al], Economic Sector, and Gases tabs, update "Arima" to all caps "ARIMA".

.... This is all I could find. ;) (Annie, @) 

## Changes if possible (hs)

1) I agree with Annie. Keep continent next to the continent drop down but change the tab to CONTINENTAL.

2) Remove exponential smoothing from the CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION graphs. 
    - when deployed in Heroku it does NOT match what is in github. 
    - Exponential smoothing appears in all the graphs in heroku.
    
3) Change the color of CONSUMPTION or PRODUCTION so they are not the same. 

4) Make the units of Y the same for both the CONSUMPTION & PRODUCTION graphs. Go from 6 to 40 BTU?

5) Change CONTINENT COMPARE to COMPARE TO.

6) Can you make the bottom drop-down half the size?

..... I think that's it. Thanks! hs

## Additional changes
1) Remove ALL exponential smoothing

2) Greenhouse Gas TAB
   * Change color line to Exponential smoothing color
   * Spelling error: COMPATE --> "COMPARE TO"
   
3) Period label for dropdowns in ALL 3 tabs
    *  change to "Forecast Period"
    
4) Continential tab shoud NOT be in all caps. I did that to point it out. sorry!
