## Changes to Make

I'm okay with "Continental" as the label for the tab, as it expresses Continental Consumption and Continental Production rather than Continent Consumption and Continent Production.  "Continent" is already in the drop down menu; this reduces reduncancy.

Place the following reference at the bottom of the page for Continent[al], Economic Sector, and Gases tabs:
DATA SOURCE: EPA (https://www.epa.gov/)

For all graphs in the Continent[al], Economic Sector, and Gases tabs, update y-axis labels from "British Termal Unit(Btu)" to "British termal unit (Btu)".  The T and the U should be lower cased and there should be a space between "unit" and "(Btu)".

Update the name of "Gases" tab to "Greenhouse Gas".

In Sector dropdown menu, capitalize "S" in "Us Territories".

In Continents dropdown menu, add "&": from "Central South America" to "Central & South America".

For all legends in the Continent[al], Economic Sector, and Gases tabs, update "Arima" to all caps "ARIMA".

.... This is all I could find. ;) (Annie, @)
